        <div class="small-text">John is a legendary hitman who had retired until a gang invades his house, steals his car, and kills the puppy that his late wife Helen had given him. This sets him on a path of revenge, returning to the criminal underworld and eventually coming into conflict with the international organization of assassins of which he was once a part of.</div>
